                            Coach Mechtild was born in Germany and has found her passion for running relatively late in life, after she welcomed her fourth child to the family. Since then, she has competed in many races with varying distances and it turned out over the years that her favorite race and sweetspot is the Marathon; she loves them so much that she even runs them back to back two weeks apart.<br><br>
                            During the pandemic, Mechtild has dipped her toes into Triathlon and proudly finished her first half Ironman distance last summer. She believes – often to the frustration of her family – in healthy nutrition and loves growing vegetables in her garden.<br><br>After three of her kids ran with Tailwind, Mechtild took over the role as Team Manager in 2017 and additionally in 2021 she joined the Tailwind Coaching team as a certified USATF Level 1 coach. She is also a certified RRCA coach and has coached adult athletes successfully to their first half and full marathons.<br><br>
                            When "Coach M“ is not busy with running, biking, swimming,strength training, or being an Uber-driver for the family, she enjoys designing and crafting quilts.

                <div class="half-split-container">

                        <p>
                            Coach Phil is focused on celebrating the joy of running and being physically active.   In high school he placed 6th in the 2-mile at the All New England championships with a 9:36.   He went on to run for one year at the University of California Santa Barbara where he was known as “the Beast from the East”.  However, he stopped competing for a decade (or two) and then in an effort to impress a fellow graduate student, who he later married, he ran a 2:48 marathon (it worked).   He has since qualified for the 70.3 Triathlon World Championships twice and biked across the United States twice.   His running goal now is to stay faster than his 10 year-old daughter, Kiki, for as long as possible.                        </p>
