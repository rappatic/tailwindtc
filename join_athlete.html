                    Thanks for your interest in our club.  As a parent of three club athletes, I can appreciate the importance of selecting the right team for your child.  First off, the Tailwind Track Club welcomes athletes of all levels – your child is not required to have any previous running experience.  We will take a runner's age, experience and previous training into account as we position them within our training groups.<br><br>
                    Our coaching staff is comprised of parents, professionals, and seasoned athletes who are dedicated to educating our athletes on the benefits of a healthy lifestyle as well as providing instruction and support to improve as an athlete.  Furthermore, the Tailwind Track Club is a 501(c) non-profit organization and everyone on our staff are volunteers – no one receives payment for their services and time.<br><br>
                    Our program is full-year in nature and we will compete in each race season (cross country, indoor track and outdoor track).  We typically compete in 4-6 local/regional meets each season and will travel to both cross country and indoor track national competitions for those athletes that qualify.<br><br>
                    We practice 4 times a week. Tuesday and Thursday practice in the spring, summer and fall is held at the White Plains High School from 7pm to 8pm. On Saturdays and Sundays, we practice in the Rockefeller Estate Park in Sleepy Hollow: Saturdays from 10am to 11am and Sundays from 8:30am to 9:30am. However, especially for younger or newer athletes, it's not necessarily required that team members attend all sessions, though we practice outside, rain or shine, and expect our athletes to be dressed accordingly. In the winter, we practice on Tuesdays and Thursdays indoors at the Draddy Gym in the Bronx and the Temple Israel in New Rochelle.
